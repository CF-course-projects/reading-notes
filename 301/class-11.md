# Mongo and Mongoose

Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
 | SQL | No SQL | 
 | --- | --- | 
 | Table based | document/key-value pair/graph or wide-column stores | 
 | Predefined Schema | Dynamic Schema | 
 | Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable | 
 | Uses Structed Query Language | Uses Unstructed Query Language | 
 | Good fit for complex/intensive queries | Good fit for hierarchical data storage and big data | 
 

- Note: 
   - Vertically scalable: scaled by increasing horse-power of the hardware.
   - Horizontally scalable: scaled by increasing the databases servers to reduce the load

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  - Complex query intensive environments, heavy duty transactional based apps
- Give a real world example.
  - MySQL
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  - Large data sets (big data), storing JSON data.
- Give a real world example.
  - MongoDB
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL DBs
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  - SQL
