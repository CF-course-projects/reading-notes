### Preface 
<p> Histortically, natice client applications held an advantage over web applications in the ability of persistent local storage.
#### Cookies provided a suboptimal workaround as they: </p>
<ul>
<li>are included with every HTTP request: which 1) slows down web applications by needlessly sending the same data over and over again and 2) sends the data unencrypted over the internet</li>
<li>Cookies are limited to 4KB of data</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML 5 Storage: <br> What is it? It allows web pages to store named key/value pairs locally in the client web browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>data is stored as key value pairs: NOTE all data is stored as string data types</li>
</ul>
