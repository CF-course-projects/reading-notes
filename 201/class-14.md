       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);

<li>Translate: The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.</li>

<p>What google learned about teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>The determining factor between good teams and bad teams is how teammembers treat eachother</li>
<li>The right group norms increased collective intelligence</li>
<li>Good teams had "equality in conversational input"</li>
<li>If one or a few individuals of the group dominated input, collective intelligence declined</li>
<li>Good teams had high social sensitivity: the members were empathetic and had high emotional intelligence</li>
<li>Psychological safety: a shared belief wherein members of a team trust that they will not be embarrassed, rejected, or punished for speaking up</li>
<li>Groups with a psychologically safe environment performed the best</li>
</ul>
