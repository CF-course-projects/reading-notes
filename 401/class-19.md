# Purely Functional Programming

Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Purely functional programming may also be defined by forbidding state changes and mutable data

- ### Differences between pure and impure functional programming
  - Purely functional data structures are persistent. Persistency is required for functional programming as without it, the same computation could return different result.
  - A prgrom is usually said to be functional when it uses concepts of function programming like first-class functions, and higher-order functions

- ### Properties of purely functional programming
  - Data structures:
    - In general, conversion of an imperative program to a purely functional one requires ensuring that formerly mutable structures now explicity return from functions that update them.
