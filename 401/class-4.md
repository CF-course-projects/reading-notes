# OOP 

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
- What is an Object? 
  - An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model real world objects.
  - objects are the building blocks of OOP. Objects have two characteristics: state and behavior. State refers to the object instance's data properties, where as behavior refers to its methods. 
  - Data encapsulation: Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
  - Benefits: 
    - Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects.
    Information hiding: By interacting only with an objects methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden
    - Code re-use: if an object already exists, you can you use that object. 
- What is a class? 
  - A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
  - classes have both instance variables and respective methods
- What is Inheritance?
  - Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
- What is an interface?
  - An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.
- What is a package?
  - A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.
